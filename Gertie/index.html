          <p>I am one special, spunky doggo! I was born in Alaska with my sisters. My "brother" Francis is my best friend, he is a cat. I love 
              cuddling with my parents on the couch, and playing fetch. I get a barkbox with 2 new toys every month! I have so many toys I don't know which one is my favorite! I have a bad habit of sometimes 
              getting into the trash. One time I took a soda can into my parents bed and shredded it. Thats why they call me the trashmouth allstar! I get really upset when my parents watch friends and clap 
              with the theme song. I actually don't like it when people clap at all.</p>
              <p>I am a super friendly puppers and I love getting all the attention. I love to give kisses and snuggle. If you reach out your hand I will give you a paw. I have very expressive eyebrows, that seems to be the first thing people notice about me. I hope you enjoy all the cute pictures of me!</p>
